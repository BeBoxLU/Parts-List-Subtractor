# Parts-List-Subtractor
This program allows you to input 2 XML files of your choosing and it outputs a 3rd XML file with the difference between the first and second file.

This requires Java to be installed on your computer as it is a jar file.

Download the .jar file and run it. It will open a simple GUI with buttons that will allow you to navigate to your files and select them. It displays the selected XML file to ensure that you have chosen the proper file. This will not work with improperly formatted XML lists or other files such as .io files. This program has no license and is free to use and distribute. If there are any issues please contact me @ beboxbricks@gmail.com, or via discord @ BeBox. All the code that is supplied is the code in the program so feel free to make modifications as needed.
